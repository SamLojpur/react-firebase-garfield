# Search For The Best Garfield Comic

An incredibly noble pursuit we took up in early 2019 to find the best garfield comic possible

## How does it work?
Work might be a strong word. In essence, we split every garfield comic panel, and then recombine the panels randomly to create 2 strips.
The user is given an oppurtunity to select the funnier strip, which makes each panel more likely to be placed into a strip in that position later!

Given enough time this strategy will eventually converge to the best possible strip (given some very generous assumptions about comedy :P)
